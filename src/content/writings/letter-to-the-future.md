Dear Future,

I write to you from a moment that will seem quaint by the time you read this. Our screens are still flat, our cars mostly stay on the ground, and we are only beginning to understand the code written in our cells. You probably smile at our limitations the way we smile at photographs of horse-drawn carriages.

But I wonder if some things remain constant across the decades or centuries that separate us. Do you still fall in love in that irrational, all-consuming way? Do you still lose sleep over problems that seem insurmountable until morning renders them manageable? Do you still find solace in music, in stories, in the company of those who understand you without explanation?

I have no way of knowing what challenges define your era. Perhaps you have solved the problems that keep us awake at night—climate change, inequality, the tendency toward tribalism that seems woven into our nature. Or perhaps you face challenges we cannot yet imagine, born from solutions we have not yet invented.

What I can offer you is this: a snapshot of consciousness from our time. We too stood at the edge of transformation, uncertain whether the path ahead led to flourishing or ruin. We too loved fiercely and feared deeply and hoped against evidence that tomorrow would be better than today.

If there is wisdom I can pass forward, it is this: the problems that seem permanent are often temporary, and the connections that seem temporary are often permanent. The specific anxieties of our age will fade, but the relationships we build, the kindness we extend, the art we create—these ripple forward in ways we cannot trace.

You are the answer to a question we are still formulating. You are the proof that we succeeded, at least enough for someone to be there, reading these words, wondering about the person who wrote them.

I hope we left you something worth inheriting.

With hope across time,
A voice from the past
